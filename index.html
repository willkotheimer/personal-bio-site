        When I started out, I wanted to break into writing. I ended up in writing camp by my Junior year of high school.

        But then, I decided I wanted to make movies, and worked on a documentary film for two years.

        I chased that dream for a number of years, along with doing lots of side jobs to pay rent, but then decided I
        wanted a career.

        About 10 years ago, I started back to school at WKU and in 2014 graduated with a Computer Science degree.

        Six years ago I moved to Nashville, and have worked in a number of jobs in development, culminating

        in my current position, working in Quality Assurance.

        I decided to go to software school because I wanted to explore some areas of development that I just

        hadn't gotten the opportunity to work with before, namely .Net and React. What I hope to get out of things

        is the chance to work in Selenium Engineering or Web App development.
