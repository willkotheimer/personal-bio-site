        <header>Background and interest in development:</header>

        <p>When I started out, I wanted to break into writing. I enjoyed the expression and community around it.

            I ended up in writing camp by my Junior year of high school. But then I pivoted; I decided I wanted to make
            movies, and worked on a documentary film for two years.

            I chased that dream for a number of years, along with doing lots of side jobs to pay rent, but then decided
            I wanted a career and a family.

            About 10 years ago, I started back to school at WKU and in 2014 graduated with a Computer Science degree.

            Six years ago I moved to Nashville, got married, and have worked in a number of jobs in development,
            culminating

            in my current position, working in Quality Assurance. I love my job for a number of reasons, not the least
            of which are the great people.

            I decided to go to Nashville Software School because I wanted to explore some areas of development that I
            just hadn't gotten the opportunity to work with before, namely .Net and React. What I hope to get out of
            this
            is the chance to work in Selenium Engineering or .Net App development.</p>
