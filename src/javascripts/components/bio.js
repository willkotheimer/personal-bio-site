  pursuing video.

  Despite some setbacks, and some hard learned lessons, I've continued to pursue it, which has given
  me a depth and understanding

  many others simply won't have. I have worked in a number of jobs in development, and seen several
  software development life cycles,

  as a developer, as technical support/consumer advocate/jack of all trades, and culminating in
  culminating in my current position, working in Quality Assurance.

  What I've learned the most is what battles to fight, when to put on the breaks and when to push the
  gas pedal, when to plan (nearly always),
  and when to ask others. What I've learned at the core of this, is that its not about my skill, its
  about
  making the best product, and encouraging others in their careers. Its ultimately about our families,
  and people.

  I love my job for a lot of reasons, not the least of which are the great people who are passionate
  about what they do.

  I decided to go to Nashville Software School because I wanted to explore some areas of development
  that I just hadn't gotten the opportunity to work with before, namely .Net and React. What I hope to
  get
  out of this is the chance to work in Selenium Engineering or .Net App development., in hopes to
  provide
  greater value and reach new understandings of developing great software.</div>`;
